    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Social networks have become a fixture of modern life, thanks to social networking sites such\n",
    "as Facebook and Twitter. Social networks themselves are not new, however. The study of such networks dates back to the early twentieth century, particularly in the fields of sociology and anthropology. It is their prevalence in mainstream applications that has moved these types of studies to the purview of data science\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of Graph Theory\n",
    "The basis for the analyses in this chapter comes from graph theory—the mathematical study of the application and properties of graphs, originally motivated by the study of games of chance. Generally speaking, this involves the study of network encoding and measuring properties of a graph. Graph theory can be traced back to Euler's work on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem in the year 1735. However, in recent decades, the rise of the social network has influenced the discipline, particularly with computer science graph data structures and databases.\n",
    "Let's start with a point of contention. What is the difference between a network and a graph?\n",
    "The term graph can be used to imply visual representations of variables and functions, the mathematical concept of a set of nodes and edges, or the data structure based on that concept. Similarly, the term network has multiple definitions; it can be an interconnected system or a specialized type of mathematical graph. Therefore, either term, social network or social graph, is appropriate in this case, particularly as we are referring to the mathematical concept and data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph problems generally fall into a few categories. Existence problems\n",
    "attempt to determine if a node, path, or subgraph exists, particularly if there is a constraint. Construction problems focus on the construction of a graph, given a set of nodes and paths, within given constraints. Enumeration problems attempt to determine the list of vertices and relationships within a set of constraints. Finally, optimization problems determine the shortest path between two nodes.\n"

    "##### The Dataset\n",
    "The dataset we will explore in this chapter is fun. It's the Marvel Universe Social Graph dataset constructed by Cesc Rosselló, Ricardo Alberich, and Joe Miro as part of their research on disordered systems and neural networks (http://bioinfo.uib.es/~joemiro/marvel. html). They created the network by compiling characters with the comic books in which they appear; as it turns out, the network actually mimics a real-world social network. Since then, there have been many visualizations of, and other mashups using this famous dataset (as well as extensions). In this recipe, we will import the needed data into our Python environment."
